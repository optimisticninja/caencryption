# caencryption

Alleged encryption algorithm using elementary cellular automata.

* Either the paper is erroneous or my implementation is. You be the judge.
  * There are unspecified CA boundaries
  * No visual confirmation of the ordering of CA rules/selected rules
  * A weird 16x4 bit split evolution that doesn't match the diagram (figure 3 in paper, which is 4x16)
